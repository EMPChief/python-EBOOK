## How to setup python env for this

To set up the Python environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

2. Create a virtual environment: It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. You can create a virtual environment using the `venv` module or a third-party tool like `conda` or `virtualenv`.
    venv:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment: Once the virtual environment is created, activate it using the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on Linux or macOS, you can use the following command:


    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    On Windows, the command would be:

    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4. Install project dependencies: With the virtual environment activated, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies. You can use `pip` to install the dependencies listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```
5. Run the project: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Python-Weather project using the appropriate command. Refer to the project's documentation or source code for instructions on how to run it.
